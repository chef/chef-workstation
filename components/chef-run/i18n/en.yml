  usage: |
    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]
    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

  usage_full: |
    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]

      Runs a single <RESOURCE> on the specified <TARGET[S]>.
      [PROPERTIES] should be specified as key=value.

      For example:

        chef-run web01 service nginx action=restart
        chef-run web01,web02 service nginx action=restart
        chef-run web0[1:2] service nginx action=restart

    chef-run <TARGET[S]> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

      Runs a single recipe located at <RECIPE> on the specified <TARGET[S]>.

      For example:

        chef-run web01 path/to/cookbook/recipe.rb
        chef-run web01,web02 path/to/cookbook
        chef-run web0[1:2] cookbook_name
        chef-run web01 cookbook_name::recipe_name

    ARGUMENTS:
      <TARGET[S]>       The hosts or IPs to target. Can also be an SSH or WinRM URLs
                        in the form:

                        ssh://[USERNAME]@example.com[:PORT]
      <RESOURCE>        A Chef resource, such as 'user' or 'package'
      <RESOURCE_NAME>   The name, usually used to specify what 'thing' to set up with
                        the resource. For example, given resource 'user', 'name' would be
                        the name of the user you wanted to create.
      <RECIPE>          The recipe to converge. This can be provided as one of:
                        1. Full path to a recipe file
                        2. Cookbook name. First we check the working directory for this
                           cookbook, then we check in the chef repository path. If a
                           cookbook is found we run the default recipe.
                        3. This behaves similarly to 'cookbook name' above, but it also allows
                           you to specify which recipe to use from the cookbook.

  CHEFINS002: |
    The target does not have chef-client installed.

    This command is powered by the Chef client.  In order to make use of it
    on this node, the Chef client must be installed first.

    Re-running this command without the '--no-install' flag will
    automatically perform the installation.

  CHEFINS003: |
    The target has an older version of Chef client installed.

    The target has version %1 installed, but this command
    requires a minimum version of %2.

    Please upgrade the Chef client on this node to version %2 or later.

  # Maps to: SSL::SSLError with message text indicating verification failure
  CHEFNET002: |
    SSL host verification failed.

    I could not verify the identity of the remote host.

    If you are certain that you are connecting to the correct host,
    you can specify the '--no-ssl-verify' option for this command, or
    make it the default by setting the following in your configuration:

      [connection.winrm]
      ssl_verify=false

  # Errors specifying target ranges
  CHEFRANGE001: |
    The target '%1' contains an invalid range.

    The range '%2' mixes alphabetic and numeric values.
    A range must be one or the other.
