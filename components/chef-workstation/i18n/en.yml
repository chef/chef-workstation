      usage: |
        USAGE:
          chef target converge <TARGET> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [ATTRIBUTES] [FLAGS]
            Converge the specified <TARGET> with the single <RESOURCE>. [ATTRIBUTES]
            should be specified as key=value. EG:

            chef target converge myec2node directory /tmp/test mode="0777" action=create

          chef target converge <TARGET> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]
            Converge the specified <TARGET> with the single recipe located at
            <RECIPE>.

            chef target converge myec2node path/to/cookbook/recipe.rb

        ARGS:
          <TARGET>          The host or IP address to converge. Can also be an SSH or WinRM URL
                            in the form:

                            ssh://[USERNAME]@example.com[:PORT]
          <RESOURCE>        A Chef resource, such as 'user' or 'package'
          <RESOURCE_NAME>   The name, usually used to specify what 'thing' to set up with
                            the resource. For example, given resource 'user', 'name' would be
                            the name of the user you wanted to create.
          <RECIPE>          The recipe to converge. This can be provided as one of:
                            1. Full path to a recipe file
