# What is this script?
#
# Chef Workstation uses Expeditor to manage the bundled version of the Delivery CLI.
# Currently we always want to include the latest version of Delivery CLI inside
# Workstation, so this script takes that version and uses sed to insert it into the
# omnibus_overrides.rb file. Then it commits that change and opens a pull request for
# review and merge.
