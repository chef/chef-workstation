# What is this script?
#
# Chef Workstation uses Expeditor to manage the bundled version of the
# Chef Workstation App. Currently we always want to include the latest version
# of Chef Workstation App inside Workstation, so this script takes that version
# and uses sed to insert it into the omnibus_overrides.rb file. Then it commits
# that change and opens a pull request for review and merge.
