# nodejs-binary provides nodejs using the binary packages provided by
# the upstream.  It does not install it into any of our standard
# paths, so builds that require nodejs need to add embedded/nodejs/bin
# to their path.
#
# Since nodejs is often a build-time-only dependency, it can then be
# easily removed with remove-nodejs.
