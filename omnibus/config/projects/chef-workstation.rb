# One problem with the ChefDK today is that it includes a shit load of gem
# dependencies.  We resolve all those dependencies in 1 location today - in the
# ChefDK repo (with its `Gemfile.lock`).

# We eventually want to fix that problem as part of implementing the Chef
# Workstation RFC (https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/308). But until we do
# we need to pull `chef-apply` in as a gem dependency of the ChefDK.

# This means the promotion process for getting new Chef Apply changes out is:
# 1. Merge the Chef Apply PR which causes expeditor to build a new gem
# 2. Update the dependencies in the ChefDK with a PR
# 3. Perform a new build of Chef Workstation. Because it pulls in ChefDK from
# `master` it will get the latest ChefDK and transitively the latest update
# to Chef Apply.

# I've automated steps 1 and 3. This means that the _new_ process for promoting
# Chef Apply changes is:
# 1. Update the dependencies in the ChefDK with a PR
# 2. After Chef Workstation gets a new build triggered and completed, promote Chef Workstation as normal

# I realize this is not ideal but I think its the best way forward today. We
# could try and do something sneaky/cute where we pull Chef Apply into
# Chef Workstation as a separate dependency but that exposes the risk that we
# break dependency resolution for the ChefDK (and transitively Chef Workstation)
