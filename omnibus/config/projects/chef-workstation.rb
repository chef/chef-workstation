# One problem with the ChefDK today is that it includes a shit load of gem
# dependencies.  We resolve all those dependencies in 1 location today - in the
# ChefDK repo (with its `Gemfile.lock`).

# We eventually want to fix that problem as part of implementing the Chef
# Workstation RFC (https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/308). But until we do
# we need to pull `chef-apply` in as a gem dependency of the ChefDK.

# In order to prevent unecessary cache expiration,
# package and package version overrides, build_version
# and build_iteration are kept in <project-root>/omnibus_overrides.rb
