Use the `chef license` subcommand to update license information on the
system or to display the already installed license(s). Chef Workstation
requires an active license to allow execution of `chef` and `knife` commands.
More information on Chef licensing can be obtained in [About Chef Licenses]
(https://docs.chef.io/chef_license/) page.
