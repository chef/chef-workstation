The `knife org` subcommand is used to manage organizations and users in Chef Infra Server.

{{< note >}}

The recommended best practice is to use the Chef Infra Server `user-` and `org-` commands to manage organizations and users instead of this subcommand. The Chef Infra Server command line tool already has the permissions that you need to manage organizations and users. Using Chef Infra Server commands centralizes the access and application of sensitive commands, which is important for system security and security audits. See the [chef-server-ctl](/ctl_chef_server/) documentation for more information.

## Required Permissions

* Administrator permissions are required to add, remove, or edit users.
* The pivotal key is required to manage organizations, or change a user's assignment to an organization.

The knife [common options](/workstation/knife_options/) are available to this (and all) knife subcommands and plugins.

## config.rb Setup

Unlike other knife subcommands the subcommands in the `knife-org` plugin make API calls to the root of your Chef Infra Server API endpoints.

The `chef_server_url` for your Chef Infra Server installation typically looks like this:

``` ruby
chef_server_url 'https://chef.yourdomain.com/organizations/ORG_NAME'
```

To configure knife-opc, set the `chef_server_root` option to the root of your Chef Infra Server installation:

``` ruby
chef_server_root 'https://chef.yourdomain.com/'
```

If your `chef_server_url` configuration ends with `/organizations/ORG_NAME` (as shown above), this setting defaults to `https://chef.yourdomain.com/`.

{{< note >}}

User subcommands or options are added under `knife user`. See the [knife user](/workstation/knife_user/) documentation for more information.
