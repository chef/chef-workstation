{{< note >}}

Review the list of [common options](/workstation/knife_options/) available to this (and all) knife subcommands and plugins.

{{< /note >}}

## Requirements

This subcommand requires WinRM to be installed, and then configured correctly, including ensuring the correct ports are open. For more information, see Microsoft's documentation on [Windows Remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WinRM/installation-and-configuration-for-windows-remote-management). Use the quick configuration option in WinRM to allow outside connections and the entire network path from knife (and the workstation). Run the following on the Windows target:

``` bash
C:\> winrm quickconfig -q
```

Often commands can take longer than the default `MaxTimeoutms` WinRM configuration setting. Increase this value to `1800000` (30 minutes).

To update this setting, run the following command on the Windows target:

``` bash
C:\> winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'
```

Ensure that the Windows Firewall is configured to allow WinRM connections between the workstation and the Chef Infra Server. For example:

``` bash
C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" profile=public protocol=tcp localport=5985 remoteip=localsubnet new remoteip=any
```

### Negotiate, NTLM

When knife is executed from a Windows system, it is no longer necessary to make additional configuration of the WinRM listener on the target node to enable successful authentication from the workstation. It is sufficient to have a WinRM listener on the remote node configured to use the default configuration for `winrm quickconfig`. This is because `knife windows` supports the Windows negotiate protocol, including NTLM authentication, which matches the authentication requirements for the default configuration of the WinRM listener.

{{< note >}}

To use Negotiate or NTLM to authenticate as the user specified by the `--winrm-user` option, include the user's Windows domain, using the format `domain\user`, where the backslash (`\`) separates the domain from the user.

{{< /note >}}

For example:

``` bash
knife winrm web1.cloudapp.net 'dir' -x 'proddomain\webuser' -P 'password'
```

and:

``` bash
knife winrm db1.cloudapp.net 'dir' -x '.\localadmin' -P 'password'
```

### Domain Authentication

The `knife windows` plugin supports Windows domain
authentication. This requires:

- An SSL certificate on the target node
- The certificate details can be viewed and its [thumbprint hex values copied](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-view-certificates-with-the-mmc-snap-in)

To create the listener over HTTPS, run the following command on the
Windows target:

``` bash
C:\> winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=IP:<ip_address>+Transport=HTTPS @{Hostname="<fqdn>";CertificateThumbprint="<hexidecimal_thumbprint_value>"}
```

where the `CertificateThumbprint` is the thumbprint hex value copied from the certificate details. (The hex value may require that spaces be removed before passing them to the node using the `knife windows` plugin.) WinRM 2.0 uses port `5985` for HTTP and port `5986` for HTTPS traffic, by default.

To validate communication with the Windows system using domain authentication run:

``` bash
knife winrm 'node1.domain.com' 'dir' -m -x domain\\administrator -P 'super_secret_password' -p 5986
```

## cert generate

Use the `cert generate` argument to generate certificates for use with WinRM SSL listeners. This argument also generates a related public key file (in .pem format) to validate communication between listeners that are configured to use the generated certificate.

### Syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

``` bash
knife windows cert generate FILE_PATH (options)
```

### Options

This argument has the following options:

`-cp PASSWORD`, `--cert-passphrase PASSWORD`

: The password for the SSL certificate.

`-cv MONTHS`, `--cert-validity MONTHS`

: The number of months for which a certificate is valid. Default value: `24`.

`-h HOSTNAME`, `--hostname HOSTNAME`

: The hostname for the listener. For example, `--hostname something.mydomain.com` or `*.mydomain.com`. Default value: `*`.

`-k LENGTH`, `--key-length LENGTH`

: The length of the key. Default value: `2048`.

`-o PATH`, `--output-file PATH`

: The location in which the `winrmcert.b64`, `winrmcert.pem`, and `winrmcert.pfx` files are generated. For example: `--output-file /home/.winrm/server_cert` will create `server_cert.b64`, `server_cert.pem`, and `server_cert.pfx` in the `server_cert` directory. Default location: `current_directory/winrmcert`.

## cert install

Use the `cert install` argument to install a certificate (such as one generated by the `cert generate` argument) into the Windows certificate store so that it may be used as the SSL certificate by a WinRM listener.

### Syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

``` bash
knife windows cert install CERT [CERT] (options)
```

### Options

This argument has the following options:

`-cp PASSWORD`, `--cert-passphrase PASSWORD`

: The password for the SSL certificate.

## listener create

Use the `listener create` argument to create a WinRM listener on the Windows platform.

{{< note >}}

This command may only be used on the Windows platform.

{{< /note >}}

### Syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

``` bash
knife windows listener create (options)
```

### Options

This argument has the following options:

`-c CERT_PATH`, `--cert-install CERT_PATH`

: Add the specified certificate to the store before creating the listener.

`-cp PASSWORD`, `--cert-passphrase PASSWORD`

: The password for the SSL certificate.

`-h HOST_NAME`, `--hostname HOST_NAME`

: The hostname for the listener. For example, `--hostname something.mydomain.com` or `*.mydomain.com`. Default value: `*`.

`-p PORT`, `--port PORT`

: The WinRM port. Default value: `5986`.

`-t THUMBPRINT`, `--cert-thumbprint THUMBPRINT`

: The thumbprint of the SSL certificate. Required when the `--cert-install` option is not part of a command.

## winrm

Use the `winrm` argument to create a connection to one or more remote machines. As each connection is created, a password must be provided. This argument uses the same syntax as the `search` subcommand.

{{% knife_windows_winrm_ports %}}

### Syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

``` bash
knife winrm SEARCH_QUERY SSH_COMMAND (options)
```

### Options

This argument has the following options:

`-a ATTR`, `--attribute ATTR`

: The attribute used when opening a connection. The default attribute is the FQDN of the host. Other possible values include a public IP address, a private IP address, or a hostname.

`-C NUM`, `--concurrency NUM`

: Changed in knife-windows 1.9.0. The number of allowed concurrent connections. Defaults to 1.

`-f CA_TRUST_FILE`, `--ca-trust-file CA_TRUST_FILE`

: Optional. The certificate authority (CA) trust file used for SSL transport.

`-p PORT`, `--winrm-port PORT`

: The WinRM port. The TCP port on the remote system to which `knife windows` commands that are made using WinRM are sent. Default: `5986` when `--winrm-transport` is set to `ssl`, otherwise `5985`.

`-P PASSWORD`, `--winrm-password PASSWORD`

: The WinRM password.

`-R KERBEROS_REALM`, `--kerberos-realm KERBEROS_REALM`

: Optional. The administrative domain to which a user belongs.

`--returns CODES`

: A comma-delimited list of return codes that indicate the success or failure of the command that was run remotely.

`-S KERBEROS_SERVICE`, `--kerberos-service KERBEROS_SERVICE`

: Optional. The service principal used during Kerberos-based authentication.

`SEARCH_QUERY`

: The search query used to return a list of servers to be accessed using SSH and the specified `SSH_COMMAND`. This option uses the same syntax as the search subcommand.

`SSH_COMMAND`

: The command to be run against the results of a search query.

`--session-timeout MINUTES`

: The amount of time (in minutes) for the maximum length of a WinRM session.

`--ssl-peer-fingerprint FINGERPRINT`

: SSL Cert Fingerprint to bypass normal cert chain checks

`-t TRANSPORT`, `--winrm-transport TRANSPORT`

## Examples

### Find Uptime for Web Servers

To find the uptime of all web servers, enter:

``` bash
knife winrm "role:web" "net stats srv" -x Administrator -P password
```

### Force a Chef Infra Client run

To force a Chef Infra Client run:

``` bash
knife winrm 'ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com' 'chef-client -c c:/chef/client.rb' -m -x admin -P 'password'
ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] INFO: Starting Chef Run (Version 0.9.12)
ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] WARN: Node ip-0A502FFB has an empty run list.
ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] INFO: Chef Run complete in 4.383966 seconds
ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] INFO: cleaning the checksum cache
ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] INFO: Running report handlers
ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] INFO: Report handlers complete
```

Where in the examples above, `[date]` represents the date and time the
long entry was created. For example:

```powershell
[Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:53 +0000]
```

### Generate an SSL certificate, and then create a listener

Use the `listener create`, `cert generate`, and `cert install` arguments to create a new listener and assign it a newly generated SSL certificate. First, make sure that WinRM is enabled on the machine. Do so by running the following command on the Windows node:

``` bash
C:\> winrm quickconfig
```

Create the SSL certificate

``` bash
knife windows cert generate --domain myorg.org --output-file $env:userprofile/winrmcerts/winrm-ssl
```

This command may be run on any machine and will output three file types: `.b64`, `.pem`, and `.pfx`.

Next, create the SSL listener:

``` bash
knife windows listener create --hostname *.myorg.org --cert-install $env:userprofile/winrmcerts/winrm-ssl.pfx
```

This will use the same `.pfx` file that was output by the `cert generate` argument. If the command is run on a different machine from that which generated the certificates, the required certificate files must first be transferred securely to the system on which the listener will be created. (Use the `cert install` argument to install a certificate on a machine.)

The SSL listener is created and should be listening on TCP port `5986`, which is the default WinRM SSL port.
