{{< /note >}}

This subcommand has the following options:

`--chef-repo-path PATH`

: The path to the chef-repo. This setting will override the default path to the chef-repo. Default: same value as specified by `chef_repo_path` in client.rb.

`--concurrency`

: The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: `10`.

`--[no-]diff`

: Upload only new and modified files. Set to `false` to upload all files. Default: `true`.

`--[no-]force`

: Use `--force` to upload roles, cookbooks, etc. even if the file in the directory is identical (by default, no `POST` or `PUT` is performed unless an actual change would be made). Default: `--no-force`.

`--[no-]freeze`

: Require changes to a cookbook be included as a new version. Only the `--force` option can override this setting. Default: `false`.

`-n`, `--dry-run`

: Take no action and only print out results. Default: `false`.

`--[no-]purge`

: Use `--purge` to delete roles, cookbooks, etc. from the Chef Infra Server if their corresponding files do not exist in the chef-repo. By default, such objects are left alone and NOT purged. Default: `--no-purge`.

`--[no-]recurse`

: Use `--no-recurse` to disable uploading a directory recursively. Default: `--recurse`.

`--repo-mode MODE`

: The layout of the local chef-repo. Possible values: `static`, `everything`, or `hosted_everything`. Use `static` for just roles, environments, cookbooks, and data bags. By default, `everything` and `hosted_everything` are dynamically selected depending on the server type. Default: `everything` / `hosted_everything`.
