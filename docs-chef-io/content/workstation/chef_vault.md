`chef-vault` is a Ruby Gem that is included in Chef Workstation and Chef
Infra Client. Chef Vault lets you encrypt a data bag item using asymmetric keys. When you provide Chef Vault with a list of public keys from your nodes, only the nodes with public keys entered on this list can decrypt the data bag item contents. Chef Vault is included in Chef Workstation and Chef Infra Client by way of the `chef-vault` Ruby Gem. `chef-vault` uses the `knife vault` subcommand.

{{< note >}}

Chef Vault does not currently support alternate keying mechanisms like GPG and Amazon KMS.

{{< warning >}}

To use Chef Vault, Chef Infra Client must be configured to use public/private key pairs. Chef Vault is incompatible with the practice of using Chef Infra Client with a private key, such as `client.pem`, and a certificate set as its public identity in the Chef Infra Server database. To update existing nodes to use `chef-vault`, first re-register your Chef Infra Client nodes with the Chef Infra Server which will generate public/private key pairs, and then install Chef Vault on each node. If Chef Vault is used with a Chef Infra Client instance that has a private key, such as `client.pem`, and a certificate set as its public identity in the Chef Infra Server database, Chef Vault will generate the following error:

``` none
## OpenSSL::PKey::RSAError
Neither PUB key nor PRIV key:: nested asn1 error
```

{{< /warning >}}

## Configuring config.rb for Chef Vault

To set 'client' as the default mode, add the following line to the config.rb file.

``` shell
knife[:vault_mode] = 'client'
```

To set the default list of admins for creating and updating vaults, add the following line to the config.rb file.

``` shell
knife[:vault_admins] = [ 'example-alice', 'example-bob', 'example-carol' ]
```

(These values can be overridden on the command line by using `-A`)

### Syntax

``` shell
knife vault SUBCOMMAND VAULT ITEM VALUES
```

where:

- `vault` names the location for storing the encrypted item.
- `item` names the item stored in the vault.
- `values` contains the data that will be encrypted and stored in the
 vault.

## Options for knife bootstrap

Use the following options with a validatorless bootstrap to specify items that are stored in Chef Vault:

`--bootstrap-vault-file VAULT_FILE`

: The path to a JSON file that contains a list of vaults and items to be updated.

`--bootstrap-vault-item VAULT_ITEM`

: A single vault and item to update as `vault:item`.

`--bootstrap-vault-json VAULT_JSON`

: A JSON string that contains a list of vaults and items to be updated. --bootstrap-vault-json '{ "vault1": \["item1", "item2"\], "vault2": "item2" }'

### Using Chef Vault in recipes

To use this gem in a recipe to decrypt data you must first install the gem via a chef_gem resource. Once the gem is installed, `require` the gem and then you can create a new instance of Chef Vault.

Chef Vault 1.0 style decryption is supported, however it has been deprecated and Chef Vault 2.0 decryption should be used instead

### Example Code

``` ruby
chef_gem 'chef-vault' do
  compile_time true if respond_to?(:compile_time)
end
#
require 'chef-vault'
#
item = ChefVault::Item.load("passwords", "root")
item["password"]
```

Note that in this case, the gem needs to be installed at compile time because the require statement is at the top-level of the recipe. If you move the require of `chef-vault` and the call to `::load` to library or provider code, you can install the gem in the converge phase instead.

### Specifying an alternate node name or client key path

Normally, the value of `Chef::Config[:node_name]` is used to find the per-node encrypted secret in the keys data bag item, and the value of `Chef::Config\[:client_key\]` is used to locate the private key to decrypt this secret.

These can be overridden by passing a hash with the keys `:node_name` or `:client_key_path` to `ChefVault::Item.load`:

``` ruby
item = ChefVault::Item.load(
  'passwords', 'root',
  node_name: 'service_foo',
  client_key_path: '/secure/place/service_foo.pem'
)
item['password']
```

The above example assumes that you have transferred `/secure/place/service_foo.pem` to your system via a secure channel.

This usage allows you to decrypt a vault using a key shared among several nodes, which can be helpful when working in cloud environments or other configurations where nodes are created dynamically.

### chef_vault_item helper

The [chef-vault cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-vault/) contains a recipe to install the `chef-vault` gem and a helper method `chef_vault_item` which makes it easier to test cookbooks that use Chef Vault using Test Kitchen.

### Determining if Item is a Vault

Chef Vault provides a helper method to determine if a data bag item is a vault, which can be helpful if you produce a recipe for community consumption and want to support both normal data bags and vaults:

``` ruby
if ChefVault::Item.vault?('passwords', 'root')
  item = ChefVault::Item.load('passwords', 'root')
else
  item = Chef::DataBagItem.load('passwords', 'root')
end
```

This functionality is also available from the command line as `knife vault isvault VAULT ITEM`.

### Determining Data Bag Item Type

Chef Vault provides a helper method to determine the type of a data bag item. It returns one of the symbols :normal, :encrypted or :vault

``` ruby
case ChefVault::Item.data_bag_item_type('passwords', 'root')
when :normal
  ...
when :encrypted
  ...
when :vault
end
```

This functionality is also available from the command line as `knife vault itemtype VAULT ITEM`.

### Stand Alone Usage

The `chef-vault` gem can be used as a stand-alone binary to decrypt values stored in Chef. It requires that Chef is installed on the system and that you have a valid `config.rb`. This is useful if you want to mix Chef Vault into non-Chef recipe code, for example some other script where you want to protect a password.

It does still require that the data bag has been encrypted for the user's or client's pem and pushed to the Chef Infra Server. It mixes Chef into the gem and uses it to go grab the data bag.

Use `chef-vault --help` to see all all available options

### Example usage (password)

``` none
chef-vault -v passwords -i root -a password -k /etc/chef/config.rb
```

### Testing

To stub vault items in ChefSpec, use the [chef-vault-testfixture](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-vault-testfixtures) gem.

To fall back to unencrypted JSON files in Test Kitchen, use the `chef_vault_item` helper in the aforementioned chef-vault cookbook.
