## Fuzzy Matching

Fuzzy matching can be used with all commands because kitchen uses
regular expressions to search. For example, a fully qualified name:

``` bash
kitchen list client-ubuntu-1804 --bare
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
client-ubuntu-1804
```

A partial name:

``` bash
kitchen list ubuntu --bare
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
client-ubuntu-1804
server-ubuntu-1804
```

A short string:

``` bash
kitchen list ub --bare
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
client-ubuntu-1804
server-ubuntu-1804
```

An integer:

``` bash
kitchen list 4 --bare
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
client-ubuntu-1804
server-ubuntu-1804
```

A single-quoted Ruby regular expression:

``` bash
kitchen list '^cli.*-65$' --bare
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
client-centos-65
```

## kitchen converge

Use the `converge` subcommand to converge one (or more) instances.
Instances are based on the list of platforms in the kitchen.yml file.
This process will install Chef Infra Client on an instance using the
Chef installer, upload cookbook files and minimal configuration to the
instance, and then start a Chef Infra Client run using the run-list and
attributes specified in the kitchen.yml file.

Test Kitchen will skip unnecessary steps. For example, if Chef Infra
Client is already installed to the instance, Test Kitchen will not
re-install Chef Infra Client. That said, Test Kitchen will always upload
the cookbook files and minimal configuration. This ensures that cookbook
testing is being done correctly.

The following exit codes are used by Test Kitchen:

- `0` means the operation was successful
- Any non-zero value means at least one part of the operation was unsuccessful

In general, use the `test` subcommand to verify the end-to-end quality
of a cookbook. Use the `converge` and `verify` subcommands during the
normal the day-to-day development of a cookbook.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen converge PLATFORMS (options)
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`-c`, `--concurrency`

: The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: `9999` (all instances, effectively).

`-l`, `--log-level`

: The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Default: `info`.

`PLATFORMS`

: Run Test Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the kitchen.yml file. Use `all` to run Test Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

kitchen-version: 1.2.2.dev
instances:
  default-ubuntu-1804
    # ...
  default-centos-8
    # ...
```

When Test Kitchen is being used to test cookbooks, Test Kitchen will
track state data:

``` yaml
---
instances:
  default-ubuntu-1804
    state_file:
      hostname: 192.0.2.0
      last_action: create
      port: '22'
      ssh_key: "/Users/username/path/to/key"
      username: vagrant
  default-centos-65
    # ...
```

and will track information that was given to a driver:

``` yaml
---
instances:
  default-ubuntu-1804
    driver:
      box: opscode-ubuntu-18.04
      box_url: https://URL/path/to/filename.box
      kitchen_root: "/Users/username/Projects/sandbox/"
```

and will track information about provisioners:

``` yaml
---
instances:
  default-ubuntu-1804
    provisioner:
      attributes: {}
      chef_omnibus_url: https://www.chef.io/chef/install.sh
      clients_path:
      name: chef_zero
```

## kitchen driver create

Use the `driver create` subcommand to create a new Test Kitchen driver
in the RubyGems project.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen driver create NAME
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

  {{< readfile file="layouts/shortcodes/chef-workstation/ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms.md" >}}

### Examples

None.

## kitchen init

Use the `init` subcommand to create an initial Test Kitchen environment,
including:

- Creating a kitchen.yml file
- Appending Test Kitchen to the RubyGems file, .gitignore, and .thor
- Creating the `test/integration/default` directory

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen init
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`--create_gemfile`

: Create a RubyGems file, if one does not already exist. Default: `false`.

`-D`, `--driver`

: Add one (or more) Test Kitchen drivers to a RubyGems file. Default: `kitchen-vagrant`.

`-l`, `--log-level`

: The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Default: `info`.

`-P`, `--provisioner`

  {{< readfile file="layouts/shortcodes/chef-workstation/ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms.md" >}}

### Examples

**Create the Test Kitchen environment**

``` bash
kitchen init --driver=kitchen-vagrant
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
create kitchen.yml
create test/integration/default
create .gitignore
append .gitignore
append .gitignore
run    gem install kitchen-vagrant from "."
Fetching: kitchen-vagrant-0.12.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed kitchen-vagrant-0.12.0
1 gem installed
```

## kitchen list

Use the `list` subcommand to view the list of instances. Instances are
based on the list of platforms in the kitchen.yml file. Test Kitchen
will auto-name instances by combining a suite name with a platform name.
For example, if a suite is named `default` and a platform is named
`ubuntu-18.04`, then the instance would be `default-ubuntu-1804`. This
ensures that Test Kitchen instances have safe DNS and hostname records.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen list PLATFORMS (options)
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`-b`, `--bare`

: Print the name of each instance, one instance per line. Default: `false`.

`-l`, `--log-level`

: The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Default: `info`.

`PLATFORMS`

: Run Test Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the kitchen.yml file. Use `all` to run Test Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

  {{< readfile file="layouts/shortcodes/chef-workstation/ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms.md" >}}

### Examples

**View a list of Test Kitchen instances**

To view the list of Test Kitchen instances:

``` bash
kitchen list
```

A list will be returned, similar to:

``` bash
Instance              Driver   Provisioner   Last Action
default-ubuntu-18.04  vagrant  chef_zero     created

```

## kitchen login

Use the `login` subcommand to log in to a single instance. Instances are
based on the list of platforms and suites in the kitchen.yml file. After
logging in successfully, the instance can be interacted with just like
any other virtual machine, including adding or removing packages,
starting or stopping services, and so on. It's a sandbox. Make any
change necessary to help improve the coverage for cookbook testing.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen login PLATFORM (options)
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`-l`, `--log-level`

: The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Default: `info`.

`PLATFORMS`

: Run Test Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the kitchen.yml file. Use `all` to run Test Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

  {{< readfile file="layouts/shortcodes/chef-workstation/ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms.md" >}}

### Examples

To login to the default Ubuntu instance, run the following:

``` bash
kitchen login default-ubuntu-1804
```

to return something similar to:

``` bash
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-51-generic x86_64)

Last login: Wed Jul  3 18:21:09 2019 from 10.0.2.2
vagrant@default-ubuntu-1804:~$
```

## kitchen setup

Use the `setup` subcommand to set up one (or more) instances. Instances
are based on the list of platforms in the kitchen.yml file.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen setup PLATFORMS (options)
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`-c`, `--concurrency`

: The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: `9999` (all instances, effectively).

`-l`, `--log-level`

: The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Default: `info`.

`PLATFORMS`

  {{< readfile file="layouts/shortcodes/chef-workstation/ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms.md" >}}

### Examples

None.

## kitchen test

Use the `test` subcommand to test one (or more) verified instances.
Instances are based on the list of platforms and suites in the
kitchen.yml file. This subcommand will create a new instance (cleaning
up a previous instance, if necessary), converge that instance, set up
the test harness, verify the instance using that test harness, and then
destroy the instance.

In general, use the `test` subcommand to verify the end-to-end quality
of a cookbook. Use the `converge` and `verify` subcommands during the
normal day-to-day development of a cookbook.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen test PLATFORMS (options)
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`--auto-init`

: Invoke the `init` command if kitchen.yml is missing. Default:
    `false`.

`-c NUMBER`, `--concurrency NUMBER`

: The number of allowed concurrent connections. Use this option to limit the number of instances that are tested concurrently. For example, `--concurrency 6` will set this limit to six concurrent instances. Default: `9999` (all instances, effectively).

`-d`, `--destroy`

: The destroy strategy used at the conclusion of a Test Kitchen run. Possible values: `always` (always destroy instances), `never` (never destroy instances), or `passing` (only destroy instances that passed). Default: `passing`.

`-l`, `--log-level`

: The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Default: `info`.

`PLATFORMS`

: Run Test Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the kitchen.yml file. Use `all` to run Test Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

### Examples

**Test the default Ubuntu instance**

To test the default Ubuntu instance, run the following:

``` bash
kitchen test default-ubuntu-1804
```

to return something similar to:

``` bash

```

**Test an instance using --concurrency option**

Use the `--concurrency` option to control the number of instances that
are tested concurrently on the local workstation. The default setting is
to test all instances, but the practical setting depends on the
capabilities of the local machine itself. The following examples will
limit the number of instances to four:

``` bash
kitchen test --concurrency=4
```

or:

``` bash
kitchen test --concurrency 4
```

or:

``` bash
kitchen test -c=4
```

or:

``` bash
kitchen test -c 4
```

## kitchen verify

Use the `verify` subcommand to verify one (or more) instances. Instances
are based on the list of platforms and suites in the kitchen.yml file.

In general, use the `test` subcommand to verify the end-to-end quality
of a cookbook. Use the `converge` and `verify` subcommands during the
normal day-to-day development of a cookbook.

### Syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
kitchen verify PLATFORMS (options)
```

### Options

This subcommand has the following options:

`-c`, `--concurrency`

: The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: `9999` (all instances, effectively).
