The `knife windows` subcommand is used to interact with Windows systems
managed by Chef Infra. Nodes are configured using WinRM, which allows
external applications to call native objects like batch scripts, Windows
PowerShell scripts, or scripting library variables. The `knife windows`
subcommand supports NTLM and Kerberos methods of authentication.
