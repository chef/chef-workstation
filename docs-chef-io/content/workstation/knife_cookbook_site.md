Use the `knife cookbook site` subcommand to interact with cookbooks that
are available in the [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/). A
user account is required for any community actions that write data to
this site. The following arguments do not require a user account:
`download`, `search`, `install`, and `list`.

{{< warning >}}

`knife cookbook site` has been deprecated in favor of the [knife
supermarket](/workstation/knife_supermarket/) command.

## Private Supermarket

To use the `knife cookbook site` command with a private Supermarket
installation, you must first add the URL of your Supermarket to your
`config.rb` file:

``` ruby
knife[:supermarket_site] = 'https://supermarket.example.com'
```

If this value is not specified, knife will use
`https://supermarket.chef.io` by default.

## download

Use the `download` argument to download a cookbook from the community
website. A cookbook will be downloaded as a tar.gz archive and placed in
the current working directory. If a cookbook (or cookbook version) has
been deprecated and the `--force` option is not used, knife will alert
the user that the cookbook is deprecated and then will provide the name
of the most recent non-deprecated version of that cookbook.

### Syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

``` bash
knife cookbook site download COOKBOOK_NAME [COOKBOOK_VERSION] (options)
```

### Options

This argument has the following options:

`COOKBOOK_VERSION`

: The version of a cookbook to be downloaded. If a cookbook has only one version, this option does not need to be specified. If a cookbook has more than one version and this option is not specified, the most recent version of the cookbook is downloaded.

`-f FILE`, `--file FILE`

: The file to which a cookbook download is written.

`--force`

: Overwrite an existing directory.

`-m SUPERMARKET_SITE`, `--supermarket-site SUPERMARKET_SITE`

: The URL at which the Chef Supermarket is located. Default value: <https://supermarket.chef.io>.

### Examples

The following examples show how to use this knife subcommand:

**Download a cookbook**

To download the cookbook `getting-started`, enter:

``` bash
knife cookbook site download getting-started
```

to return something like:

``` bash
Downloading getting-started from the cookbooks site at version 1.2.3 to
  /Users/grantmc/chef-support/getting-started-1.2.3.tar.gz
Cookbook saved: /Users/grantmc/chef-support/getting-started-1.2.3.tar.gz
```

## install

Use the `install` argument to install a cookbook that has been
downloaded from the community site to a local git repository . This
action uses the git version control system in conjunction with the the
[Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks) site to
install community-contributed cookbooks to the local chef-repo. Using
this argument does the following:

1. A new "pristine copy" branch is created in git for tracking the upstream.
2. All existing versions of a cookbook are removed from the branch.
3. The cookbook is downloaded from the [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks) in the tar.gz format.
4. The downloaded cookbook is untarred and its contents are committed to git and a tag is created.
5. The "pristine copy" branch is merged into the master branch.

This process allows the upstream cookbook in the master branch to be
modified while letting git maintain changes as a separate patch. When an
updated upstream version becomes available, those changes can be merged
while maintaining any local modifications.

### Syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

``` bash
knife cookbook site install COOKBOOK_NAME [COOKBOOK_VERSION] (options)
```

### Options

This argument has the following options:

`-b`, `--use-current-branch`

: Ensure that the current branch is used.

`-B BRANCH`, `--branch BRANCH`

: The name of the default branch. This defaults to the master branch.

`COOKBOOK_VERSION`

: The version of the cookbook to be installed. If a version is not specified, the most recent version of the cookbook is installed.

`-D`, `--skip-dependencies`

: Ensure that all cookbooks to which the installed cookbook has a dependency are not installed.

`-m SUPERMARKET_SITE`, `--supermarket-site SUPERMARKET_SITE`

: The URL at which the Chef Supermarket is located. Default value: <https://supermarket.chef.io>.

`-o PATH:PATH`, `--cookbook-path PATH:PATH`

: The directory in which cookbooks are created. This can be a colon-separated path.
