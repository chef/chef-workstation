# Workstation API Service
## Overview

This service is a REST API built using Ruby on Rails that serves as an intermediary between the Workstation GUI app, the chef cli and knife gems.
The chef-cli and knife gems included in the workstation are loaded with this service, and their functionalities will be exposed through API so that the Workstation GUI app can consume those and carry out the corresponding actions.

## Authentication

A simple JWT Token based authentication is implemented in order to prevent API invocation from unidentified/remote apps and to confirm the legitimacy of the workstation GUI app.
We are utilising a random `access_key` that will be generated during the installation on the user's machine to authenticate the API.

Below is a list of all the procedures involved in the JWT authentication.

- A new `access_key` and `secret_key_base` will be generated by the rails application and saved in the rails credentials in encoded form during the workstation installation.
- Then the `access_key` will be copied to a file inside the installation directory so that the GUI can access that file and use the `access_key` for authentication.
- GUI will call the login API with the `access_key`.
- The server will verify the `access_key` with the one saved in the credentials and generated a new JWT token using the `secret_key_base` if it is valid.
- The GUI can later on use the JWT token to access the protected URLs.
- In 24 hours, the JWT token will expire. When the current one expires, a new one can be obtained via the auth API.
